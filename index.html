  This is my GitHub Pages. I, SorrowEater, am a person who..<br>
  Basically, I do whatever I want, and because my interests<br>
  all revolve around technology, I end up doing a ton of<br>
  projects. I am proficient in Python, I know a tiny bit<br>
  of HTML, and I'm learning C (and maybe Java). I'm a HUGE<br>
  weeb, and I'm a Linux enthusiast. I'm the kind of person<br>
  you would find reading a book during class, disregarding<br>
  the teacher. Most people won't want to be freinds with me,<br>
  but I really don't care. I'm proud of who I am, and other<br>
  people's opinions don't matter to me. Below, you will, one<br>
  day, see a list of my projects, and a guide in you will find<br>
  how to get started with programming.
