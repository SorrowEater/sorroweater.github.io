  <a href="https://github.com/SorrowEater/" style="color:#2B8000">Here's</a> my GitHub! Sorry, there isn't much to see here...
  This is my GitHub Pages. I, SorrowEater, am a person who..
  Basically, I do whatever I want, and because my interests
  all revolve around technology, I end up doing a ton of
  projects. I am proficient in Python, I know a tiny bit
  of HTML, and I'm learning C (and maybe Java). I'm a HUGE
  weeb, and I'm a Linux enthusiast. I'm the kind of person
  you would find reading a book during class, disregarding
  the teacher. Most people won't want to be freinds with me,
  but I really don't care. I'm proud of who I am, and, quite
  honestly, I'm proud of you too, if you read through this boring
  paragraph. I must assume you wish to learn how to become a nerd?
  Let's begin <em>your</em> nerdy adventures!</p>
